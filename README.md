# A* Pathfinding Algorithm

![Astar_progress_animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33559521/230699253-ab25da94-4f26-4a75-a134-e8e963be3609.gif)

This is a simple A* pathfinder created in C#. I optimised it using a priority queue from my <a href="https://github.com/PixelSir/PriorityQueue">Priority Queue Repo</a>. I have not added threading support as this is merely a demonstration of the algorithm. Ideally to use this in any serious capacity for many pathfinding agents you will want to use threads.

# Preview

Provided is a Unity3D demo of the pathfinder being generated whilst the points move to random new locations. The demo can be found in Unity Demo -> Scenes. Simply load the scene in Unity and press play.
